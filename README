ReadMe for PMG5617GA (V5.40(ABNA.0)C0)==============================================


0. Introduction

  This file will show you how to build the PMG5617GA linux system,
  please note, the download image will overwrite the original image existed in the flash memory of EV board.


1. Files list

   A. README					- This file

   B. V540ABNA0C0_GPL.tar.bz2	- Open Source Code of PMG5617GA and Open Source Code of Toolchain


2. Prepare the build OS.

   A. We suggest using the Linux distribution to setup your environment for reduce compatible issue.

	Install Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop 32bit

   B. Update system

       Use GUI interface to update system or use command to update system.

	$ sudo apt-get update
	
   *Note: If update failed, edit /etc/apt/sources.list as following link
	deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main
	deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main
	deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main
	deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main
	deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe
	deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe
	deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates universe
	deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates universe
	deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-security main
	deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-security main
	deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-security universe
	deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-security universe


   C. Change default /bin/sh link to /bin/bash

	$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash
	choice "no" and press enter.


3. Prepare the compiler environment

   Install the following necessary tools 

	$ sudo apt-get install -y g++ flex bison gawk make autoconf zlib1g-dev libncurses-dev git subversion gettext


4. Extract the open source code

	$ tar jxf <FW Tarbal File>


5. Build the firmware for Web-GUI upgrade using

   Change the directory into extrated directory

	$ cd <extrated directory>

	
   Clean and build the firmware

	$ make dirclean
	$ make


6. The image is in the images directory.

    The firmware image will locate at <extrated directory>/bin/en75xx/zyxel/ras.bin
    You can use it update PMG5617GA by using the firmware update procedure.


README 2================================================================

This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl
make, find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, libz-dev and libc headers.

Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use "scripts/flashing/flash.sh" for remotely updating your embedded
system via tftp.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type "make -C docs/" to build it.

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.


Sunshine!
